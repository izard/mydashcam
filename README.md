# mydashcam
Personal dash cam, that stores only text after speech to text and image recognition.

In most countries, it is illigal to record images and speech of strangers, that limits usage of personal dash cams. 
This dash cam does not record anything, but uses Baidu text to speech and image recognition locally to store only text and timings, for your records.

Current design is a bit heavy.
